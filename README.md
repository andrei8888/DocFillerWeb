# DocFiller
Web application that fills your documents instantly. 
Document completion is an important task to legitimize the relationship between two parties. But it's usually a tedious and disliked process. That's why I created a simple app that fills the dread away.
DocFiller lets you add the informations for a person, either manually or by applying OCR on a romanian identity card, select the documents you want to fill out and download them instantly.

!Important! DocFiller is only a simulation app and includes only a selection of documents to be completed. It is not suited as a reliable way of actually filling the documents.
